## About Me

<!-- <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="images/cmu-logo.png" alt="CMU" style="width:275px;" align="right"></a> -->

I am a Data Infrastructure Engineer at LinkedIn, building and scaling our Data Computation Platform to support LinkedIn's Data Science and Machine Learning needs. Our platform has democratized doing scalable data science to hundreds of engineers, data scientists and data analysts while preserving trust in data. We compute ~2000 Hadoop workflows, serving over 20K metrics (as of March 2019) with varying time granularities (monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly) supporting a wide range of compute engines like Spark, Hive and Pig.

I graduated from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh (PA)</a> with a Masters (MS) in Computer Science (awarded by the Information Networking Institute) in May 2018. I was a Graduate Research Assistant (my old PDL page <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PEOPLE/souptik.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>) at the <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Parallel Data Lab</a>, which is an <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/about.shtml" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Systems Research Centre</a>at CMU advised by <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/" target="_blank">Prof. Gauri Joshi</a>, working on the <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/Research.html" target="_blank">Distributed Machine Learning</a> project, from 2017-2018. In 2017, I spent an awesome summer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Sunnyvale working with the <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank">Big Data Engineering team</a> on Hive to SparkSQL translation. Previously, I graduated from <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Birla_Institute_of_Technology,_Mesra" target="_blank">Birla Institute of Technology</a> with a Bachelors of Engineering (BE) in 2013, followed by a brief stint as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ca.com/us.html" target="_blank">CA Technologies</a> in their Hyderabad and Toronto offices.</p> 

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">I was born and raised in Bhilai, a beautiful town in Central India which is home to India's largest integrated <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bhilai_Steel_Plant" target="_blank">Steel plant</a>. I have a bit of wanderlust and love travelling and going on hikes, thereby exploring different environments, cultures and cuisine. My favourite getaways are places with scenic natural beauty (next on my hitlist is driving along the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/road-trips/california-pacific-coast-road-trip/" target="_blank"> Pacific Coast highway</a>). On weekends, I can be found catching the latest Bollywood masala movie with friends, swimming at the <a href="https://www.calsportscenter.com/activities/dropin/open-swim/" target="_blank">California Sports Center</a> or simply lazing around in my bed (with an UberEats delivery next to me :P). I love to critique (uh... eat) food- passing judgements on how it could be better (thanks to my years of diligent watching Gordon Ramsay rip apart elaborate dishes on <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MasterChef_(American_TV_series)" target="_blank">Masterchef, USA</a>), peppering it with some wisdom I got from when I took cooking classes on <a href="https://olivesforlunch.com/cooking-class/" target="_blank">Moroccan cuisine</a>  (I have pictures for proof).</p>

Someone once told me that the best way to learn something is to learn together in a group of like-minded individuals. Since everyone will have their own unique understanding of the same concept (which is shaped by their knowledge and experiences) we get to know parallel perspectives on the same problem. To foster group learning, I run a Computer Science Reading Group in Mountain View, CA where we read classic books and papers on Distributed computing, Data mining and Machine Learning. We usually meet on Saturdays and Sundays. If you want to relearn challenging CS concepts in a fun setting, making some cool friends on the way, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:susen@linkedin.com">susen@linkedin.com</a>.





## Research Interests

<a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank"><img src="images/linkedin.png" alt="CMU" width="275" align="right"></a>

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">
Broadly, my interests lie in the realm of Big Data, Large scale Machine Learning and Distributed Systems. My current research is on optimizing the performance of <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/Research.html" target="_blank">Large-scale Machine Learning systems</a>, where training is performed by running stochastic gradient descent in a distributed fashion (using a central parameter server and multiple learner servers). In such systems, synchronization delays due to straggling learners can significantly increase the run-time of the training job. We are working on new algorithms that try to mitigate straggler effects in Synchronous SGD, whilst keeping a decent gradient quality and convergence time. We are also working on algorithms to reduce communication overhead in Distributed Synchronous SGD. </p>

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">
In Summer 2017, I was a Software Engineering intern with LinkedIn's <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank">Data team </a>, where I wrote a data tooling library in Scala for query translation from Hive to Spark. To test my library, I prepared an optimized workflow (after tuning various Spark metrics) for Metrics Computation on LinkedIn's Ads data pipeline.
