## About Me

<!-- <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="images/cmu-logo.png" alt="CMU" style="width:275px;" align="right"></a> -->



<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">
I am Graduate student advised by <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/" target="_blank">Prof. Gauri Joshi</a>, working on the <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/Research.html" target="_blank">Distributed Machine Learning</a> project at <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Parallel Data Lab</a> at CMU. In 2017, I spent an awesome summer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Sunnyvale working with the <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank">Data team</a> (can't wait to return there full-time in August 2018). I graduated from <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bhilai_Steel_Plant" target="_blank">Birla Institute of Technology</a> with a Bachelors degree in 2013, followed by a brief stint as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ca.com/us.html" target="_blank">CA Technologies</a> in their Hyderabad and Toronto offices.</p> 

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">I was born and raised in Bhilai, a beautiful town in Central India which is home to India's largest integrated <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bhilai_Steel_Plant" target="_blank">Steel plant</a>. I have a bit of wanderlust and love travelling and going on hikes, thereby exploring different environments, cultures and cuisine. My favourite getaways are places with scenic natural beauty (next on my hitlist is driving along the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/road-trips/california-pacific-coast-road-trip/" target="_blank"> Pacific Coast highway</a>.) </p>





## Research Interests

<a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank"><img src="images/linkedin.png" alt="CMU" width="275" align="right"></a>

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">
Broadly, my interests lie in the realm of Big Data, Large scale Machine Learning and Distributed Systems. My current research is on optimizing the performance of <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/Research.html" target="_blank">Large-scale Machine Learning systems</a>, where training is performed by running stochastic gradient descent in a distributed fashion (using a central parameter server and multiple learner servers). In such systems, synchronization delays due to straggling learners can significantly increase the run-time of the training job. We are working on new algorithms that try to mitigate straggler effects in Synchronous SGD, whilst keeping a decent gradient quality and convergence time. We are also working on algorithms to reduce communication overhead in Distributed Synchronous SGD. </p>

<p align="justify" style="max-width:575px">
In Summer 2017, I was a Software Engineering intern with LinkedIn's <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data" target="_blank">Data team </a>, where I wrote a data tooling library in Scala for query translation from Hive to Spark. To test my library, I prepared an optimized workflow (after tuning various Spark metrics) for Metrics Computation on LinkedIn's Ads data pipeline.
